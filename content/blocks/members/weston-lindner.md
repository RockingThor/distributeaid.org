bio: My deep passion for Distribute Aid's mission is informed by my experience at
  a food distribution NGO in Hamilton, Ohio and my studies of security, peace, and
  conflict at Duke University.  As Head of Projects, I work to ensure that we pursue
  our projects with intentionality and a strong connection to the mission of DA.  As
  Head of Administration, I work to empower DA contributors through effective onboarding,
  policies, and remote volunteer opportunities.
