bio: I joined Distribute Aid as Ukraine Response Coordinator on 5th September 2022.
  Coming from a background in finance, my aim is to draw upon previous experience
  to grow the Ukraine Response Project, ensuring the position Distribute Aid takes
  is effective and helpful to the beneficiaries on the ground. My history volunteering
  in the refugee sector and an ongoing desire to help improve the situation makes
  this role an exciting opportunity!
