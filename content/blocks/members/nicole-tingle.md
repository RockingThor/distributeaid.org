bio: I joined Distribute Aid after spending a year volunteering with an emergency
  response team on one of the Greek islands. We received a lot of aid from DA and
  I wanted to find out more so applied for a six month long position. Two years later
  and I am Director of Operations meaning I support the team in their direction and
  strategy as well as working on expansion of the organisation in a range of ways!
