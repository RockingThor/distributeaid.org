bio: I’m Sara, the Founder and Director of Distribute Aid! I decided to start Distribute
  Aid because I wanted to help local, grassroots organisations access services to
  make their missions easier to fulfil. I have a background in International Development
  and Humanitarian Emergencies with an MSc from LSE. Previously, I have co-founded
  the Refugees Care initiative and worked briefly on the international policy side
  at the Middle East Policy Council.
