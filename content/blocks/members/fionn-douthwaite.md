bio: I joined Distribute Aid in January 2022 as a full time logistics coordinator.
  I chose to join DA after previously working for organisations in both Calais and
  Greece as I saw a chance to make use of my studies and experiences to support the
  infrastructure of grassroots aid networks. My main focus is supporting shipments
  and customs clearances in Greece, the Balkans and Eastern Europe. I enjoy the new
  and constantly changing challenges that logistics in this field involves.
