bio: I joined DA in September 2022 as a Logistics Coordinator for DAs Ukraine Response
  Project. Prior to DA I spent 1.5 years working in NGOs in Northern France where
  I worked to support displaced people there. My aim in Ukraine Response Project is
  to facilitate the movement of aid, using various methods, to support IDPs as well
  as displaced people in neighbouring countries.
