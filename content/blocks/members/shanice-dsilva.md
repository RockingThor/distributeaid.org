name: Shanice D'Silva
pronouns: she/her
bio: I am one of the logistics coordinators at Distribute Aid since January 2022.
  I mainly coordinate shipments to France, Lebanon and The Balkans. Previous experience
  in Calais and Tanzania has helped me with certain aspects of my job at DA. Navigating
  through rules around tax relief, labour strikes and increased transportation costs
  have been challenges we have faced this year but has helped build out our network
  of trusted partners and increased the regions we are able to support.
