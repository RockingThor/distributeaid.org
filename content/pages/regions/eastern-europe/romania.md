  - title: Survey of Ukrainian refugee experiences
    content: A survey by the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) found that 68% of refugees
      from Ukraine who live in Poland, Romania, and Moldova [struggle to meet basic
      needs](https://www.nrc.no/news/2023/february/ukraine-refugee-survey/) and risk
      falling into poverty. The survey also revealed that refugees in collective centres,
      mothers and children, pensioners, and people with disabilities need help accessing
      basic necessities. Around 45% of refugees reportedly skip meals, while Ukrainian
      refugees in Poland and Moldova (especially Roma refugees) say they have been
      moved to substandard housing and have been forced to borrow money for survival.
      The NRC is calling on host countries and international donors to ensure the
      continued protection of refugees from Ukraine by developing policies that will
      prevent people from falling into further hardship.

      subsidies may become more restricted as concerns arise about people abusing
      this scheme.

    content: Romania [released a report detailing its response](https://ec.europa.eu/migrant-integration/library-document/romania-report-national-response-those-displaced-ukraine_en)
      to Ukrainian refugees. As of January 2023, the country has spent €76 million
      on housing and €152 million on food for refugees, while 19,594 have received
      emergency medical care. However, infrastructure is still lacking for elderly
      and disabled people, and fewer Ukrainian children than expected are enrolled
      in Romanian schools.

      sovereignty and territorial integrity, and continue the process of European
      integration,” said both countries in a joint statement.

overview: According to the UNHCR, over 1.7 million [Ukrainian refugees had entered
  Romania](https://reliefweb.int/report/romania/regional-refugee-response-plan-ukraine-situation-inter-agency-operational-update-romania-august-2022#:\~:text=Operational%20context,to%20remain%20in%20the%20country.)
  by the end of August 2022. However, Romania has primarily been a country of transition
  since 94.9% of Ukrainians who have entered have also departed from Romania to move
  onward to other countries or back to Ukraine.

governmentResponse: Romanian authorities have, on numerous occasions, been accused
  of [violent pushbacks](https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/europe-and-central-asia/romania/report-romania/).
  Despite this, Romania is becoming [a more frequently used route](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/32629/romania-poor-peoples-route-to-europe)
  for PoM. It is considerably easier to enter compared to either Croatia or Hungary
  if one travels from Serbia. Still, in comparison to other surrounding states, Romania
  may be easier to enter because it is not part of the Schengen area.  There have
  been [numerous reported instances of police brutality](https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/32629/romania-poor-peoples-route-to-europe),
  often resulting in bruises, fractures, and broken bones. [Romanian officials have
  on several occasions denied that any pushbacks](https://ecre.org/balkan-route-croatia-and-romania-deny-systemic-pushbacks-despite-overwhelming-evidence-ngos-point-to-eu-complicity-and-urge-stronger-response-croatian-border-monitoring-toothless/)
